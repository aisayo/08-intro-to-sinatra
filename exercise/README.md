For this exercise:

1. Make sure that the migrations have been ran
2. Create some seed data for the Pizza class
3. Create a PizzaController that inherits from ApplicationController
4. Define a '/pizzas' route that will respond with all of the pizza's in JSON format when a request is made
5. Define a route that will create a new pizza object upon a form submission.
6. Use Postman to test out both of these routes. First make a GET request from Postman and observe the response. What do you see? What is the status code of the request? Then make a POST request that submits form data. Place a pry in the POST route and inspect the params. How can a new pizza be created with the given params?
